# Config Help
I usually name the settings weirdly or don't explain them well enough so I made some README files to help.

You can find the README files inside of the branch list at the top left (The dropdown box that says 'master' and then select the plugin name)

Links to README if wanted:
- [CoX Scouting QoL](https://github.com/Filofteia/FilosPlugins/blob/CoX-Scouting-QoL/README.md): A plugin that allows you to filter raids
